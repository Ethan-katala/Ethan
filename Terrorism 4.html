<h1>How can terrorism solve world problems?</h1>
<b> <i>What are the aims of terrorism and its impact?
According to <p>https://www.knowdets.com/what-is-terrorism.</p>The goal of terrorism generally is to destroy the public's sense of security in the places most familiar to them. Major targets sometimes also include buildings or other locations that are important economic or political symbols, such as embassies or military installations. How terrorism affects the world?
Key Takeaways. Terrorist acts can cause ripple effects through the economy that have negative impacts. The most obvious is the direct economic destruction of property and lives. Terrorism indirectly affects the economy by creating market uncertainty, xenophobia, loss of tourism, and increased insurance claims.
Countering Terrorism

Terrorist groups such as ISIS, al-Qaâ€™ida, and Hizballah continue to plot attacks against the United States and our allies and partners. As the threats posed by these organizations continue to evolve, the Department of State works to build global consensus to degrade and defeat these adversaries.  Through a combination of diplomatic engagement and foreign assistance, the Department works with foreign government partners to build the capabilities necessary to prevent, degrade, detect, and respond to terrorist threats.  This includes efforts to strengthen law enforcement and judicial capabilities, expand aviation and border security, deepen global information sharing, counter terrorist financing, improve crisis response, and counter violent extremism.  Through its global engagement, the State Department promotes greater burden sharing to address terrorist threats and encourages countries to build counterterrorism capacity in their own regions.  The State Department also works closely with the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, Treasury, and the Intelligence Community to lead an integrated whole-of-government approach to international counterterrorism. Terrorism can wake the world up and the government. Terrorism can wake the world up and give us more security.
